Do you like money (For example Gambling bot)? It's a bot like this but mixed with some utils so we can say it's Gambling Gadget c:

##### Why money?
Because popular bots like dyno have the moderation and the discord has moderation built-in so this wouldn't have sense...

##### Do you have drugz?
nope

##### Do you have da casinas?
nope

##### So what you have?!?!?
money and some utils (for example embeds)
ofc the most popular bots like da carl have the embeds but these feathures are in web dashboard and it's not practical...

### Can i use this project src in my project?
Hmm... Yes! But you must add link to this project or link to file that you used in your project. (But my code is not best and i recommend writing it yourself c:)
